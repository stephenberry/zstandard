        // The `prefix_len == 0` arm is the attached-CDict path, and it is a

        // a lead, on the reasoning that the source match state's own

        // bound this by `target - (1 << windowLog)`. C's invariant is the

        // `dictMatchState` in the same branch (`zstd_compress_internal.h:1315`)
        // and says so — "loadedDictEnd may be 0, if forceWindow is true, but in
        // that case we never use dictMatchState" — with `zstd_compress.c:3289`
        // asserting the pairing. So while a dictionary is attached the
        // `isDictionary` arm always wins and the floor is `window.lowLimit`,
        // which equals `dictLimit`: the index of the first source byte, and
        // therefore *zero* in the source-relative coordinates used here. The `1`
        // excludes only the phantom position that the zero-filled hash heads use
        // to mean "empty".
        //
        // Driven rather than read: an oracle printing both candidate floors per
        // block took the `isDictionary` arm on every attached row, at a floor of
        // exactly 0 relative to the first source byte. The single row that took
        // `withinWindow` had already dropped the dictionary, which is the
        // never-expiring extDict problem and not this arm.
        //
        // C can afford "no bound" here because it guarantees it has left
        // dictMatchState before the buffer can outgrow the window --
        // `ZSTD_window_enforceMaxDist` drops the dictionary the moment
