//! Long-distance matching: the matcher, its table, and its parameters.
//!
//! LDM is a coarse matcher that finds very long matches at distances the
//! per-block parsers cannot reach, because their tables are sized to the search
//! window rather than to the whole history. What happens to its matches
//! depends on the parser: below `btopt` they are *taken* and the parser runs
//! on the gaps between them, while `btopt` and above search as they always
//! would and price each long-distance match as one more candidate. Both live
//! in [`plan_sequences_for_contiguous_block_with_ldm_into`](super::plan_sequences_for_contiguous_block_with_ldm_into);
//! this module produces the matches and the cursor over them, and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! Three parameter rules here are transcribed from the pinned checkout, and
//! each decides what the table looks like rather than being visible on its own:
//!
//! - the **window force**, `zstd_compress.c:1646`;
//! - the **auto rule**, `zstd_compress.c:272`;
//! - the **default derivation**, `ZSTD_ldm_adjustParameters`, `zstd_ldm.c:135`.
//!
//! Two of the three were first written straight from the C and were still
//! wrong; `oracles/ldm/compare.sh` is what found them, by compiling a harness
//! against the pinned checkout and diffing both the 5184-row parameter grid and
//! the generated sequences. Change anything here and run it.
//!
//! A dictionary is supported throughout. [`LdmSource`] puts one in front of the
//! frame in a single index space, and [`LdmState::fill_from_dictionary`] hashes
//! it in the way `ZSTD_loadDictionaryContent` does -- a different walk from the
//! one generation makes, which is why it is a different function.
//!
//! [`resolve_enable_ldm`] is implemented and tested but still not consulted by
//! the encoder. That is no longer about a dictionary: honouring the rule would
//! change default output at level 22 above 64 MiB and nowhere else, and nothing
//! in the suite encodes a body that large. See the note in
//! `compression_parameters_with_overrides` and Phase 3 in
//! `docs/PARITY_PLAN.md`.

// `resolve_enable_ldm` has only tests for callers, and a handful of constants
// are named for the reader rather than used twice.
