/// of defect that round-trips through our *own* decoder and fails on a
/// conforming one:
///
/// - **strategy**, via [`DECODABILITY_LEVELS`];
/// - **window size**, via two input sizes, because the row match finder is
///   gated on `windowLog > 14` and the chain planners below it store
///   differently;
/// - **framing**, via one-shot and streaming, which lay their blocks out
///   differently and carry repeat offsets across block boundaries differently;
/// - **the long-distance matcher**, which is off by default and so reached by
///   none of the above. Its store runs *after* whichever strategy the level
///   selected and inherits that parser's repeat offsets, which makes it the one
///   place in the crate where a store can be handed state it did not build.
///   Coding a repcode against the third of those offsets is a real defect that
///   fails only on a conforming decoder, because Fast and DoubleFast leave that
///   slot stale; this axis is what catches it.
///

///
/// What is *absent* is as informative as what is here: `window_log` and

/// residue is concentrated in `min_match`, and most of these rows differ by
/// six bytes or fewer with several differing by none at all — parse ties
/// rather than a systematic difference.
///
/// The one family that is not a tie is `min_match: Some(7)` against a
/// dictionary, where this crate comes out 170 to 222 bytes *smaller*.
/// [`a_min_match_of_seven_is_only_upstreams_cliff`] pins the shape of it, which
/// is sharper than the sizes suggest: upstream's 6 and 7 are byte identical
/// with no dictionary loaded and diverge by 149 to 196 bytes with one, and 7 is
/// the only value that does this — its 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all the same frame
/// once a dictionary is present. This crate's 7 costs it nothing either way.
///
/// Why 7 is upstream's cliff is not settled here. See that test for the reading
/// that fits half the levels and the measurement that rules it out for the
/// other half.
///
/// Rows here still have to round-trip and still have to come out no larger
/// than upstream by more than a small margin, so a regression is caught.
/// Rows where an override moves upstream's frame and leaves ours unchanged, or
/// the reverse.
///
/// Three rows stood here when the sweep stopped skipping rows whose baseline
/// already differed. Two were `search_log=2` on the raw dictionary, and their
/// cause was a floor: `compression_parameters_for_input` used to raise
/// `search_depth` to at least 8 whenever the dictionary was raw content, so an
/// override asking for `1 << 2` compares silently got 8 and the parse could not
/// move. C floors nothing — `ZSTD_insertBt1` and the lazy searches take
/// `1U << cParams->searchLog` as given, and raw content reaches
/// `ZSTD_loadDictionaryContent` by the same route a full dictionary does. With
/// the floor gone both rows engage and land within three bytes of upstream.
///
/// The note that used to stand here read the gap as an applied-cparams
/// difference on the dictionary path. That was wrong: the applied parameters
/// were identical on both sides, override included, which is what sent the
/// search past them and into the match finder.
///
/// The one row left is not the same shape. Both sides apply `min_match:
/// Some(7)` — the parameter is not being dropped — and upstream's frame moves
/// only because 7 is a cliff for it once a dictionary is loaded, while ours is
/// flat. It is a divergence in this crate's favour, and it is left alone.

///
/// - With no dictionary, upstream's 6 and 7 are the *same frame*, byte for byte.

/// - This crate is flat across 3..=7 with the dictionary and never pays for 7
///   without it.
///
/// **What is not established is why 7 is upstream's cliff.** The reading that
/// suggests itself is a clamp asymmetry: C clamps `minMatch` into a hashable
/// range at every search (`BOUNDED(3, .., 6)` at `zstd_opt.c:896`, `BOUNDED(4,
/// .., 6)` at `zstd_lazy.c:1531`) while `ZSTD_updateTree` (`zstd_opt.c:584`)
/// and `ZSTD_insertAndFindFirstIndex` (`zstd_lazy.c:661`) pass
/// `ms->cParams.minMatch` straight into `ZSTD_hashPtr`, so a preload at 7 would
/// file the dictionary under a hash no search ever asks for.
///
/// That reading is refuted for the lazy levels and only survives for the
/// binary-tree ones. `ZSTD_resolveRowMatchFinderMode` enables row hashing
/// whenever `windowLog > 14` (`zstd_compress.c:243`), which holds at every
/// level here, so level 6's preload runs `ZSTD_row_update` — and that one
/// *does* clamp, `MIN(minMatch, 6)` at `zstd_lazy.c:952`, agreeing with its
/// search. Level 6 degrades by as much as level 12 with no asymmetry to blame.
/// Clamping this crate's own preload to 6 to reproduce the effect changed no
/// byte anywhere in the suite, which is a third strike against it.
///
/// So the assertions below pin the *measurements* and not a mechanism. The
/// upstream half is deliberate: it holds a pinned checkout to behaviour that is
/// arguably a bug, and a version that changed it would fail here rather than
/// silently leave the recorded row unexplained.

/// enabling long-distance matching also forces the window to `1 << 27` and the
/// level's own strategy would then be chosen from a different table row on both
/// sides at once, which proves less than it looks.
///
/// **This asserted byte parity until 2026-08-06, and did so on a shrinking
/// fraction of its own grid.** It compared the matcher's frame only on rows
/// whose *no-matcher* frame already matched upstream byte for byte, so that a
/// difference was attributable to the matcher rather than inherited. Right
/// discipline, and it assumes the baseline can match. As this crate diverges
/// from upstream on purpose the baseline stops matching and rows drop out
/// silently: with the row-lazy repcode substitution applied, 64 of 81 compared
/// rows became 51. Worse, the loss is disguised as success -- the single entry
/// in the old `LDM_KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` disappeared from the actual set, which
/// reads exactly like a divergence being fixed. It was not fixed; its baseline
/// stopped matching, so the row was skipped before the comparison it was named
/// for ever ran.
///
/// What replaces it compares each side against *itself*, so no row is ever
/// excluded. Both properties below hold on all 81 rows, measured with and
/// without the divergence:
///
/// 1. **Engagement.** Enabling the matcher changes our frame if and only if it
///    changes upstream's. This is the sharp one and the reason a size bound
///    alone will not do: at this window long-distance matching is often a
///    *loss*, and on a corpus where it finds nothing it must leave the frame
///    alone. A matcher that had quietly stopped running would satisfy any
///    bound that only asks us not to grow.
/// 2. **Never larger.** Our frame with the matcher is no bigger than upstream's
///    with the matcher. This is the objective, stated one-directionally for the
///    same reason `KNOWN_UPSTREAM_SIZE_GAPS` is.
///
/// A third was tried and dropped: that the matcher should cost us no more
/// *relatively* than it costs upstream, `(ours_on - ours_off) / ours_off <=
/// (theirs_on - theirs_off) / theirs_off`. Rearranged, that is algebraically
/// the old parity-gated bound, and it fails on four rows -- `json-records` at
/// strategies 3, 4 and 5 and `wikipedia` at 6 -- in every one of which we are
/// *smaller* than upstream with the matcher on. It measures our baseline being
/// better, not our matcher being worse, so it decays exactly as the byte gate
/// did.
///
/// That leaves one hole worth naming: our matcher could get materially worse
/// against our own no-matcher frame and still satisfy both properties, so long
/// as it stayed under upstream's. That question belongs to a different layer.
/// `tests/baseline.rs` records this crate's own long-distance output per row
