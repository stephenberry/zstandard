//! **Layer 2 of `docs/ORACLE_PLAN.md`: does the parse still agree where the
//! encoding does not?**
//!
//! Byte-identical literals are the sharp instrument here. The literals section
//! is the input minus the matched regions, so if it matches upstream's byte for
//! byte then the match/literal partition agrees, which pins every match's
//! position and length without asserting anything at all about how the offsets
//! were coded. Add an equal sequence count and equal compression modes and the
//! only remaining freedom is the sequence bitstream. That is enough to localise
//! a defect to one side of the parse/encode line in a single test run.
//!
//! **This is a diagnostic, not a gate.** It references upstream's *choices*, so
//! it decays as this crate deliberately improves on them. Written as a gate it
//! would fail on success: a parse that finds a longer match than upstream's is
//! a better parse and different literals. So every row is classified and the
//! classification recorded, and a row is allowed to move toward *weaker*
//! agreement only by editing the record, which is where the reviewing happens.
//!
//! Deliberately an integration test rather than a `#[cfg(test)]` one in
//! `src/encode.rs`, where its ancestor lived. `SequencePlan::trace_enabled`
//! defaults to `cfg!(test)`, so a unit test runs the *tracing* planner copies
//! and an integration test runs the `_no_trace` copies that ship. A structural
//! comparison is worth much more against the code that ships.
